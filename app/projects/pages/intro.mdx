I am most comfortable with Python and SwiftUI to code out most automations and applications. I learnt C++ when I started using Arduino for more engineering related projects and React when building this website. 
I have base knowledge of shell script to navigate in the terminal on linux based systems, mainly MacOS, and within MacOS have dabbled with applescript for automation. 

## Software
For coding I use Visual Studio Code for creating scripts and automations. \n
I use XCode for developing applications native to the Apple ecosystem (Look at [Swift Accelerator Programme](https://swiftinsg.org)). 
Arduino IDE is used for coding microcontrollers like the Arduino UNO and other related boards. (See Integrated Design Challenge)
Apart from coding I have also used other design and media softwares. Using DaVinci Resolve to edit videos for projects. I use Figma for any UI designs and drafting up 2D designs. I am no UI/UX designer by any stretch but I do now how to use Figma to a good degree. (See Building a Peronsal Website and Making Mootivator)
I use Fusion360 for designing and creating accurate 3D CAD models. I previously used Blender for 3D CAD due to familiarity with the controls, however I now mainly use it to render out designs made in Fusion360. (See SST Ã— Magorium)

## Hardware
The hardware that I have interacted with and know how to use are mainly from my time the Robotics Club (See Robotics@ Apex)
I first interacted with LEGO technic with the EV3 and Spike Prime systems. I learnt the basics of structuring a robot and managing things like centre of gravity, modular design and making robot designs structurally stable. I then moved on to VEX robotics, where constructing a robot is harder than the snap-fit pieces of lego, requiring careful planning and many hours of hard work. (See Competitions)
In classes, I would use Arduino to power my projects to collect data from sensors. I have also used the Raspberry Pi for basic Machine Learning applications. (see Integrated Design Challenge)
I attended a workshop by Infineon Semiconductor, and had the chance to interact with the PSoC system on chip boards. (update when the workshop is over) (See PSoC Microcontroller Workshop)
I also have experience operating a 3D printer and some basic knowledge of operating a Laser Cutter. (See BigD Camp, Ender 3 Pro, VIVITA)
