# What is it about?

# Brief
In response to challenges posed by Earthquakes and other 
natural disasters, there is a pressing need to design and 
construct a specialised vehicle for disaster management and 
supply operations. 

### Key criteria:
1. **Mobility and Maneuverability:** \
Vehicles should support resource retrieval by being capable of 
navigating to the disaster zone using the safe path and equipped 
with appropriate retrieval tools.

1. **Sensing and Detection Capabilities:** \
Incorporating advanced sensors, imaging systems, 
and detection technologies, the vehicle should facilitate the 
identification of survivors and other critical information. 
Data collection and analysis capabilities are 
essential for informed decision-making and situational awareness.

1. **Communication and Command Integration:** \
Seamless integration with communication networks, command centres, 
and other rescue assets is essential for coordinated operations 
and interoperability.

### Task 1
Line track from the Home to the Red Zone, pick up a lego block and return to home base. 
### Task 2
Line track from the middle of the field to the Yellow Zone, classify if there is a human, dinosaur or nothing in the frame.
### Task 3
Line track from the Home to the Green Zone, classify between a fire and temperature icon and carry out the corresponding action.
