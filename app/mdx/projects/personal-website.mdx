# Overview

This website started when I was in my final year of secondary school. I wanted to create a platform to showcase my projects and experiences in a more interactive way than a traditional resume.

I decided to build the website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and host it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). This allowed me to create a more dynamic website that could be easily updated and maintained. 

Of course, I started out with almost no knowledge of web development, so I had to learn almost everything from scratch. I started off by finding a template from Vercel's [example kits](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit). I then started to customise the website to fit my needs and style.

The current version of the website is highly customised and has a lot of features that I have added over time.

- Responsive Design
- Custom Components (Images, Cards)
- [.mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) pages (markdown-x file)
- Recursive file search (Searchs all subfolders in the root folder)

# Reflections
After building most of the website, I realised that I had learned a lot about web development and design. I had also learned that building a website is not just about the code, but also about the design and user experience.
