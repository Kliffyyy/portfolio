# Overview
The Electronics Coursework is a project that I did in my final year of secondary school under the Electronics Applied Subject that [SST](/mdx/pages/education) offered.

The project setting was to create a musical metronome that could be used by musicians to keep time while playing music.

The Metronome had to be fully electrical, with no micro-processors or micro-controllers allowed.
