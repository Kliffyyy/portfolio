While the Swift Accelerator Programme of 2023 may be over, I really enjoyed the times I had with my team and this is project that I will remember for some time to come. 

## Reflections
After spending 3 months on this project, I have learnt a more about the process of developing an app from scratch. From the Ideation, Design, Development and Testing, I have a better understanding of what it takes to create a successful app.
