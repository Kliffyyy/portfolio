This was where I the phrase "serve to lead" was ingrained in me. 
Only by helping others can I gain the respect and trust to lead my peers.

This is where I am currently studying at, 
where a major part of my education emphasises applying what 
I have learnt into real-world applications. (Applied Learning)
