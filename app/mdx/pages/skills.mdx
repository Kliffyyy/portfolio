## Coding
I am most comfortable with Python and SwiftUI to code out automations and apps. 
I learnt Swift through the [Swift Accelerator Programme](https://swiftinsg.org) and have been using it to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem.
I learnt C++ when I started using Arduino for more engineering related projects and subsequently learnt used the React framework when building this website. 
I have some knowledge of shell script to navigate in the terminal on linux based systems, and have dabbled with applescript for automation. 

### Languages
I use Visual Studio Code for most of my coding and XCode for developing applications native to the Apple ecosystem. 
Lastly, Arduino IDE for coding microcontrollers like the Arduino UNO and other compatible boards.

1. **Python:** Scripting, Automation, Data Analysis, Machine Learning
1. **Swift:** iOS Development
1. **C++:** Arduino, Robotics
1. **React (HTML, CSS, Typescript, Javascript):** Web Development
1. **Shell Script:** Command Line, Automation
1. **Applescript:** Automation

### Tools (IDE's)
1. **VSCode:** Python, React + any others
1. **XCode:** Swift
1. **Arduino IDE:** C++
1. **Git:** Version Control

## Software

Apart from coding I have also used other design and media softwares. Using DaVinci Resolve to edit videos for projects. I use Figma for any UI designs and drafting up 2D designs. I am no UI/UX designer by any stretch but I do now how to use Figma to a good degree. 
I use Fusion360 for designing and creating accurate 3D CAD models. I previously used Blender for 3D CAD due to familiarity with the controls, however I now mainly use it to render out designs made in Fusion360.

### Tools
1. **Fusion360 (previously used Blender):** 3D CAD

## Hardware
The hardware that I have interacted with and know how to use are mainly from my time the Robotics Club
I first interacted with LEGO technic with the EV3 and Spike Prime systems. I learnt the basics of structuring a robot and managing things like centre of gravity, modular design and making robot designs structurally stable. 
I then moved on to VEX robotics, where constructing a robot is harder than the snap-fit pieces of lego, requiring careful planning and many hours of hard work.
In classes, I would use Arduino to power my projects to collect data from sensors. I have also used the Raspberry Pi for basic Machine Learning applications.
I attended a workshop by Infineon Semiconductor, and had the chance to interact with the PSoC system on chip boards. (_workshop is ongoing_)
I also have experience operating a 3D printer and some basic knowledge of operating a Laser Cutter. 

### Platforms
1. **VEX Robotics:** Robotics
1. **LEGO Technic (EV3, Spike Prime):** Robotics
1. **Arduino:** Microcontrollers 
1. **Raspberry Pi:** Machine Learning 
1. **PSoC:** System on Chip usage by Infineon Semiconductor
1. **3D Printer:** Used for rapid prototyping and creating parts for projects.
1. **Laser Cutter:** only taught how to use, never used for projects before.
