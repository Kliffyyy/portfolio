# Overview
I started my leadership journey in Primary School, 
while that may be a long time ago, 
I believe that they were the most formative to my character. 
Learning the basics of leading and working well with others.

As I progressed on to Secondary School, 
I was voted as the Class Chairperson in the first month of 
Secondary School life and under the guidance of my teachers, 
I decided to join the Student Council in Secondary 2. 
In my 3 Years in the Student Council I helped to organise 
and facilitate events. 

Moving on to Secondary 3, I was voted as the Vice-Chairperson [Robotics@ Apex](/mdx/areas/robotics/robotics-at-apex). 
There I worked with the other Executive Committee 
members to manage over 70 members in the club. 

Over my years in leadership, I honed my skills in communication,
delegation, time-management and organisation. 
Making me a more effective leader.
