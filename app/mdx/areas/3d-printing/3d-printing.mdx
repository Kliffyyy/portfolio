# What is 3D Printing?
3D Printing is like a normal printer... \
But instead of printing ink on paper, it prints objects in 3D with a medium like plastic or metal.
It started in the 1980s and has since grown to be a popular way to prototype and manufacture objects.
The most common forms of 3D printing are Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Stereolithography (SLA) 
more commonly known as traditional 3D printing and Resin 3D printing respectively.

## Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)

FDM is the most common form of 3D printing. A FDM printer heats a plastic filament to its melting point and extrudes it 
layer by layer to form an object. This process gives FDM prints a characteristic layered look. \
It is commonly used for prototyping and hobbyist projects due to its low cost and ease of use.

## Stereolithography (SLA) / Resin 3D Printing

SLA is a form of 3D printing that uses a laser to cure a liquid resin layer by layer to form an object. 
It is commonly used for its high detail and accuracy in prints due to the nature of the process.

# About

I obtained the [Ender-3 Pro](/mdx/areas/3d-printing/ender-3-pro) by Creality in 2022. 
I started off knowing nothing about this manufacturing technique and have since learned how to design and print objects
by learning to use CAD design software and 3D Slicer software.

## Projects

Currently I only use the Ender-3 Pro for prototyping and small upgrades to my printer. \
I have not yet used it for any major projects.
